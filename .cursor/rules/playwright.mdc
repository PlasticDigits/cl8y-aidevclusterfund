# Playwright Testing Configuration

When running Playwright tests in this project, always use 20 workers for maximum parallelization.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
cd frontend && npx playwright test --workers=20

# Run with debug/headed mode
cd frontend && npx playwright test --workers=20 --headed

# Run specific test file
cd frontend && npx playwright test deposit.spec.ts --workers=20
```

## Important Notes

- The system has 24 CPU cores available
- Using 20 workers provides good parallelization while leaving headroom
- Tests that modify shared state (deposits, tranches) are marked with `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })`
- Always restart devnet before running tests for a clean state: `./scripts/devnet-stop.sh && ./scripts/devnet-start.sh`
