# Devnet Testing Workflow

This project includes scripts for running a local Anvil devnet with deployed contracts.

## Scripts

- `./scripts/devnet-start.sh` - Start Anvil, deploy contracts, start frontend
- `./scripts/devnet-status.sh` - Check if devnet is running (reads `.devnet-status.json`)
- `./scripts/devnet-stop.sh` - Stop all processes and clean up

## Usage Pattern

```bash
# 1. Start devnet
./scripts/devnet-start.sh

# 2. Check status (useful before interactions)
./scripts/devnet-status.sh

# 3. Test in browser at http://localhost:5173
# 4. Use Browser MCP for automated testing

# 5. ALWAYS stop devnet when done
./scripts/devnet-stop.sh
```

## Important Rules

1. **Always check status first**: Before starting, run `devnet-status.sh` to see if already running
2. **Always stop after testing**: Call `./scripts/devnet-stop.sh` after verifying work is complete
3. **Status file**: `scripts/.devnet-status.json` contains PIDs and deployed addresses

## Test Account

The test wallet auto-connects in test mode:
- Address: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`
- Balance: 100,000 USDT (mock)
- Has admin permissions

## Cleanup Reminder

After any browser testing or E2E verification, ensure you run:

```bash
./scripts/devnet-stop.sh
```

This prevents orphaned Anvil/Vite processes.
